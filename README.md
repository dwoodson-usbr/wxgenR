# wxgenR: Weather Generator for Simulating Precipitation and Temperature

**wxgenR** is a novel weather generator designed to simulate ensembles of precipitation and temperature data for regions with distinct seasonality. By incorporating up to 26 seasons as training variables, it offers users a robust scenario-planning tool for analyzing potential impacts of phenomena like climate change on seasonality.

## Features

- **Seasonality Support:** Incorporates up to 26 seasons, allowing for detailed examination of shifts in season start, end, and duration.
- **Flexible Input Data:** Handles single time series from sources such as station measurements, basin averages, grid cells, or model outputs.
- **Simulation Outputs:** Provides an ensemble of precipitation and temperature traces, preserving essential statistical characteristics of wet/dry day transitions.
- **Customizable Settings:** Includes configurable options like sampling window width, adaptive sampling, and temperature perturbation.
